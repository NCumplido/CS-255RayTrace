Lecture 1

I handed out the first half of the course notes.

I handed out the assignment.

I showed Photoshop. The overall aim was to get across the fact that we will be learning algorithms and not how to use packages.

In Photoshop, I showed:

The RGB eyedropper tool (to explain RGB colour), curves, filters etc.

For the assignment, I talked through the requirements, submission procedure and aims in great detail.

I introduced the assignment framework, and went through the code line by line to introduce the various features, and discuss how the assignment could be implemented within the framework.

I recommended a work schedule, indicated that students should download and familiarise themselves with the code template immediately, and get gamma correction working within the week.

#############

Lecture 2 (Given by Ric)

Ric covered gamma correction, which is the first part of the assignment.

He also went through the code again, line by line.

############

Lecture 3

Idea of mappings introduced. Gamma correction is a mapping. Discussed coding again. Contrast stretching.

#############

Lecture 4 will be histrograms and histogram equalisation

#############

Lecture 5

Cross correlation introduction and algorithm. The Gaussian spreadsheet is used in the lecture to describe how to create the filters.
Spatial Linear Filtering - going through the main stages of the cross correlation algorithm. I also discussed filters: size of filters, how they are derived, high and low pass filters. Filters within photoshop were also shown so we have the context of the algorithm.

#############

Lecture 6 (20/2/2017)

Recap of all 4 parts of the assignment.

#############

Lecture 7
More about the theory of cross correlation. In particular how we can derive an edge detection algorithm from finding the peak in the first derivative or the zero-crossing in the 2nd derivative. Did first derivative in detail.

#############

Lecture 8
Second derivative.
Image denoising.
Template matching.

#############

Lecture 9 (27/2/2017)
Image resizing.
Linear interpolation (including equation). Bilinear interpolation. Image resizing as an example. Nearest neighbour vs. bilinear vs. bicubic interpolation.

#############

Lecture 10
Error diffusion dither

#############

Lecture 11
Halftoning

#############

Lecture 12 (6/3/2017)
Cross correlation revision

#############

Lecture 13
I handed out the 2nd half of the notes - they are already on blackboard.
I didn't have quite enough copies - I will bring more on Thursday, then put them in the course tray outside Talbot 043.

Object representation - implicit, parametric, triangles.

#############

Lecture 14
Ray tracing

#############

Lecture 15 (13/3/2017)
Ray tracing - ray/sphere intersection equation, parallel coding, recursive ray tracing

#############

Lecture 16
Bounding volumes, hierarchical bounding volumes, octrees, kdtree. Example on laptop.

#############

Lecture 17
Illumination and shading

#############
(20/3/2017 cancelled)
#############

Plan:
Lecture 18 (21/3/2017)
Anti-aliasing and sampling patterns

#############

Lecture 19
MIP+Volume data
Colour models

#############

Lecture 20 (27/3/2017)
We agreed (almost unanimously) that since the course is complete, I would do the recap in the previous lecutre and overrun the time slightly. Then we do revision after Easter.
So this lecture, and all further lectures this term are cancelled.

#############

Revision lectures after Easter - starting 2/5/2017
